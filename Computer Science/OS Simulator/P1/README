DESCRIPTION:
						Unix System Calls and Library Functions
The savelog function saves the logged messages to a disk file. 
The clearlog function releases all the storage that has been allocated for 
the logged messages and empties the list of logged messages. 
The getlog function allocates enough space for a string containing the entire log, 
copies the log into this string, and returns a pointer to the string. 
It is the responsibility of the calling program to free this memory when necessary.
If successful, addmsg and savelog return 0. 
A successful getlog call returns a pointer to the log string. 
If unsuccessful, addmsg and savelog return â€“1. 
An unsuccessful getlog call returns NULL. 
These three functions also set errno on failure.
