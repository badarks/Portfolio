To reproduce the result:
	In nextword folder, there are ui.r and server.r file
	You need to host the server with specific URL in order to deploy the server by typing deployApp() function in R studio.
	I used free shiny app server with limited deplyment time.
	task0.r ~ task6.r is the source file to build the model in ui.r 

What i have learned:
	Critical thinking to generate problem solving methods
	Coding R in depth
	Data manipulation skills
	User friendly webapp deployment using shiny app

Future study:
	I'm planing to work with Dr. He to build the AI model that solve the math problem.
	Also I'm planing to participate Hackathon with Lane and most likely we will be using AI to impress the judges.

What have i done for past few months?
	Collect data from twitter API (0.5 GB Data)
	Clean data
	remove bad words and symbols, 
	wonâ€™t -> will not, etc
	Create N-gram up to 4
	Calculate Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
	Data Explanatory Analysis
	Build the Model based on 
		the N-gram data set with MLE
	Develop Front-end and Back-end for UI
