Assume x,y coordinate is marked when people start to search for the location on their smartphone

Assume they have way to check the information online right away
	meaning they know following info
		which place is closer
		which place is popular
		if the place is close or open
	but they do not know
		if the place if full
		so ex) if person check A when place 1 is closer but it's full at that time then move to next
			need to know the population distribution at that time... 
			if it's full, then they have to go to second option
		

so eventhough the location is closer, we need to assume the following
	people will check for
		rating (popularity)
		distance 
		time (if time is okay, person is willing to drive furture)
			find the pattern
			most active time is closer to day time
			least active time is closer to night time
		capacity at that time		

		
density that at that time because if the location is full then go to the closer one?
	how to determin next one 
		rating (popularity)
		distance 
		time

cleaning x,y ?
	Set some threshhold for location accuracy to reduce the noise

New variables
cluster them by x,y
	hour, day
croud level
	by hour, day
open and close time
popularity rank by total count

distances for next possible one
Finding the maximum, minimum, average capacity 
	within the hour, day interval 

centroid for each location

 time section each id has unique pattern or cycle. there is a daily pattern for individual places. 
	increase section
	horizontal section
	decreasing section

May need to change the time into repeatable pattern since the time is continous
some business are seasonal
